Exercise 00 - Add, Subtract and Scale

Maximum time complexity : O(n)
Maximum space complexity : O(n)
This project provides three functions that perform basic mathematical operations on vectors:

    add(vector1, vector2): This function computes the addition of two vectors. Both vectors must be of the same size for the operation to be valid. Otherwise, the result will be undefined.

    subt(vector1, vector2): This function computes the subtraction of one vector from another vector. Again, both vectors must have the same size for a valid operation.

    scl(vector, scalar): This function scales a vector by a scalar. The vector will be multiplied by the specified scalar to obtain the result.

This project provides three functions that perform basic mathematical operations on matrices:

    add(matrix1, matrix2): This function computes the addition of two matrices. Both matrices must have the same dimensions (same number of rows and columns) for the operation to be valid. Otherwise, the result will be undefined.

    subt(matrix1, matrix2): This function computes the subtraction of one matrix from another matrix. Again, both matrices must have the same dimensions for a valid operation.

    scl(matrix, scalar): This function scales a matrix by a scalar. The matrix will be multiplied by the specified scalar to obtain the result.
