Exercise 00 - Add, Subtract and Scale

This project provides three functions that perform basic mathematical operations on vectors:

    add(vector1, vector2): This function computes the addition of two vectors. Both vectors must be of the same size for the operation to be valid. Otherwise, the result will be undefined.

    subt(vector1, vector2): This function computes the subtraction of one vector from another vector. Again, both vectors must have the same size for a valid operation.

    scl(vector, scalar): This function scales a vector by a scalar. The vector will be multiplied by the specified scalar to obtain the result.
```
# Addition of two vectors
vector1 = [1, 2, 3]
vector2 = [4, 5, 6]
result_addition = addition_of_vectors(vector1, vector2)
# The result should be [5, 7, 9]

# Subtraction of one vector by another vector
vector3 = [7, 8, 9]
vector4 = [3, 2, 1]
result_subtraction = subtraction_of_vectors(vector3, vector4)
# The result should be [4, 6, 8]

# Scaling a vector by a scalar
vector5 = [2, 4, 6]
scalar = 3
result_scaling = scaling_of_vector(vector5, scalar)
# The result should be [6, 12, 18]
```
